# LeetCode All in C

I want to solve LeetCode questions but only with C this time, and I will upload solutions here.

Any PR about the existing solutions is welcomed, while that for the nonexistent solutions isn't since I want to solve them myself first.

## Prerequisites

* A C compiler

## Usage

Use your C compiler on your computer to compile each solution and run it, simple as that.

## Content

In every solution provided here, there must be a main function in it to provide an example input to the solution function.

The example inputs used here typically came from the question descriptions provided by LeetCode itself originally.
